# Groundwater Modelling Decision-Support Initiative
## Tutorials on decision-support modelling with non-scripted workflows

In order to assist modellers in setting up and using model-partner software in ways that support the decision-support imperatives of data assimilation and uncertainty quantification, GMDSI is developing a series of tutorials.

GMDSI tutorials are designed to be modular and independent of each other. Each tutorial addresses its own specific modelling topic. Hence there is no need to work through them in a pre-ordained sequence. However, they also complement each other. Many employ variations of the same synthetic model, and are based on the same simulator (MODFLOW 6).

In these tutorials, utility software from the PEST suite is used extensively to assist in model parameterization, objective function definition, and general PEST/PEST++ setup. Some tutorials focus on the use of PEST and PEST++, while others focus on ancillary issues such as introducing transient recharge to a groundwater model, and translation of a modelâ€™s grid, parameterization, and calculated states to files that can be read by visualization, GIS and display packages.

A separate set of tutorials demonstrate scripted workflows using `pyEMU` and `PEST++`: https://github.com/gmdsi/GMDSI_notebooks
